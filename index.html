                <hr>
           <p>I have been devoting the majority of my free time to do what I love most: reading.<br>It is just wonderful to let myself lose into a whole new world every time I open a book. It can be the fascinating world of magic in "Harry Potter", or the mystery world of space and time in "A brief history of time". To me, reading is simply a great way to unwind at the end of a stressful day and enjoy my own imaginations.<br>Reading comes as the most useful facility for me to see this wonderful world through others' eyes, thus offering me the scenes of all over the world.</p>
